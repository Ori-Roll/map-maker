### map-maker
Procedurally created a map.
A work in progress, this is an experiment with procedurally creating a map.
The creator first creates clusters of mountains (ridges) according to a few initial
parameters. The code then makes a 2d points precipitation map and proceeds to simulate how
the water in each point will flow from higher areas to lower ones, thus creating irrigated
areas (that will grow trees) where water accumulates, and areas where water overflows,
creating rivers and lakes.
Eventually the map will come with a menu allowing you to choose the amount of mountains
and their composition, the amount of rain, affecting rivers and vegetation, houses (to be
placed organically where people might want to live) and other map elements.
